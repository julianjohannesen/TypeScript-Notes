# Installing TS

Each of the resources mentioned in the README has a section on installing TS. However, the best explanation I've found so far is on Execute Program and can be found [here](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics/articles/how-to-install-typescript).

Here are other resources on installing TS from the resources listed in the README:

- From Jess Chadwick's course on LinkedIn: [Installing TypeScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/installing-typescript?autoplay=true&resume=false)
- From the book [TypeScript Quickly](https://www.manning.com/books/typescript-quickly): Section 1.3 (pp 9-12)
- The [Official Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) has a whole section on Project Management, but if you're just starting in development, it will be a bit advanced.
