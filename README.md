# Notes on TypeScript

Some notes while watching [TypeScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/) on LinkedIn Learning. 

Note that I installed the recommended packages via NPM as they were suggested throughout the progress of the course. So, if you're stumbling upon this repo and want to use it, you'll want to delete the list of packages in package.json, and also package-lock.json.
