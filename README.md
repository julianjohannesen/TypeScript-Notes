# TypeScript Notes

Notes I took while:

- Watching Jess Chadwick's [TypeScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/) on LinkedIn Learning
- Reading the official TS docs and in particular the [Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- Reading [TypeScript Quickly](https://www.manning.com/books/typescript-quickly) by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev

Note that as I was watching the LinkedIn course, I installed the recommended packages via NPM as they were suggested throughout the progress of the course. So, if you're stumbling upon this repo and want to use it while you watch the course, you'll want to edit package.json in order to remove the list of dependencies, and also completely delete package-lock.json. That way, you too will be able to install the packages as you go.

Note also that I did not include here all of the exercise files associated with the LinkedIn course, but rather a sampling with new file names explaining the point(s) each file makes.

## Keeping Track of Where I am

I just finished lesson 2 of the video training. I'm currently reading more about generics in the TS official docs. In the book, I'm reading chapter 2 on Basic and Custom Types. 
- I need to take notes on the part of chapter 2 of the book
- I need to finish chapter 2 of the book
- I need to read more of the TS official documentation and take notes on that as well
- I need to continue on to chapter 3 in the video lesson
