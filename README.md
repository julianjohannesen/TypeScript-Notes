# Notes on TypeScript

Some notes I took while watching [TypeScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/) on LinkedIn Learning. 

Note that I installed the recommended packages via NPM as they were suggested throughout the progress of the course. So, if you're stumbling upon this repo and want to use it while you watch the course, you'll want to edit package.json in order to remove the list of dependencies, and also completely delete package-lock.json. That way, you too will be able to install the packages as you go.

Note also that I did not include here all of the exercise files associated with the course, but rather a sampling with new file names explaining the point(s) each file makes.
