# TypeScript Notes

Notes I took while:

- Watching Jess Chadwick's [TypeScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-essential-training-14687057/) on LinkedIn Learning
- Reading the official TS [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- Reading TypeScript Quickly by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev

Note that as I was watching the LinkedIn course, I installed the recommended packages via NPM as they were suggested throughout the progress of the course. So, if you're stumbling upon this repo and want to use it while you watch the course, you'll want to edit package.json in order to remove the list of dependencies, and also completely delete package-lock.json. That way, you too will be able to install the packages as you go.

Note also that I did not include here all of the exercise files associated with the LinkedIn course, but rather a sampling with new file names explaining the point(s) each file makes.
